# DriveWise – Smart & Responsible Driving Companion

DriveWise is an intelligent mobile solution designed to enhance road safety, improve driver awareness, and promote eco-friendly driving. The system includes a mobile application connected to a SmartBox installed inside the vehicle. The SmartBox contains a forward-facing camera that observes the driver and analyzes their state in real time.

DriveWise combines driver monitoring, behavior analysis, and contextual alerts to help users adopt safer and more responsible driving habits.

## SmartBox – Driver Monitoring

- Compact smart device installed in the vehicle.
- Uses a built-in camera to monitor:
	- fatigue
	- distraction
	- focus level and attention
	- driver actions
- If a risk is detected, real-time alerts are sent to the mobile application.

## Driving Behavior Analysis

- Uses smartphone sensors:
	- GPS
	- accelerometer
	- gyroscope
- The app detects:
	- harsh braking
	- sudden acceleration
	- speeding
	- unsafe turns
- The driver receives safety alerts and personalized recommendations.

## External Data Integration

- DriveWise retrieves contextual information through external APIs:
	- weather conditions
	- speed limits
	- recommended routes
	- environmental impact (CO₂ estimation)
- This information helps the driver make better decisions on the road.

## Multi-Dimension Scoring System

- DriveWise generates a global score that reflects three key dimensions:
	- Driving Behavior Score (smoothness, anticipation, safety)
	- Law-Compliance Score (seatbelt usage, focus, distraction)
	- Eco-Driving Score (energy efficiency, CO₂ impact)
- The user can follow their evolution over time through clean and informative dashboards.

## Real-Time Alerts & Dashboards

- The application provides:
	- instant warnings for detected risks
	- a complete overview of each trip
	- historical performance trends
	- a driver-monitoring view
	- advice to improve overall performance

## Role of AI

- Interpret the driver’s state through the SmartBox camera
- Classify driver behaviors
- Detect distraction, fatigue, and law-compliance events
- Analyze driving patterns and risk indicators

## RSE Impact

- Road safety: fewer accidents caused by fatigue or distraction
- Environment: reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions
- Accessibility: simple guidance for drivers of all profiles

Overall, DriveWise supports a preventive, data-driven approach to safer mobility.
